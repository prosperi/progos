			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct semaphore_elem
  {
    struct list_elem elem;              /* List element. */
    struct semaphore semaphore;         /* This semaphore. */
+   struct thread *thread;        /* The waiting thread. */
  };

To get the thread with the highest priority waiting for a condition the waiting
threads are stored in the waiter-list with the semaphores.

struct lock
  {
    struct thread *holder;      /* Thread holding lock (for debugging). */
    struct semaphore semaphore; /* Binary semaphore controlling access. */
+   struct list_elem elem;      /* Each thread keeps a list of held locks. */
  };

The threads need to keep a list of the locks they hold, so
thread_get_priority_of(), can determine what priority is donated by the waiting
threads.

struct thread
  {
    ...
+   /* Owned by synch.c */
+   struct list locks;                  /* List of held locks. */
    ...
  };

The list of locks held by a thread is stored in the thread struct.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

Priority donation is tracked by 1) keeping track of all locks that a thread
holds, 2) holding a reference to the thread owning a lock, and 3) keeping
a list of all threads waiting for a lock.

 ----------    held locks     ----------                   ----------
|          |   --------->    |          |                 |          |
|  Thread  |   lock holder   |   Lock   |   ---------->   |Semaphore |
|          |   <---------    |          |                 |          |
|          |                  ----------                  |          |
|          |               waiting threads                |          |
|          |        <---------------------------          |          |
 ----------                                                ----------

1) is achieved using a new list in thread struct and the corresponding element
member in thread lock. 2) as well as 3) were already part of the existing lock
implementation.

At all times, a thread's priority is the maximum of its static priority (set
by thread_set_priority() and its donated priority. The donated priority is
determined recursively by querying all held locks for maximum priority held
by a thread on its waiting list, which again returns the maximum of the threads'
static and donated priorities.

These data structures are updated whenever lock_acquire(), lock_try_acquire(),
and lock_release() are called.

real pri: 3              real pri: 3              real pri: 3
 --------                 --------                 --------
|Thread A|  waits for X  |Thread B|  waits for Y  |Thread C|
|pri: 1  | <------------ |pri: 2  | <------------ |pri: 3  |
|locks: X|               |locks: Y|               |        |
 --------                 --------                 --------

In the case of nested priority donation (see diagram), in order to determine the
real priority of thread A, we have to determine the real priority of B, which in
turn requires us to determine the real priority of C. To do this we could call
thread_get_priority_of() for each thread, waiting for A and then recursively
call it for every thread waiting for any of those and so on. This takes time and
if the threads are in a deadlock it may never return.

This is prevented by using thread_get_priority_recursive() which takes an
integer argument and increases it for every level of waiting threads. If
thread_get_priority_recursive() is called with an argument > PRI_MAX_RECURSION
it returns without calling itself again.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

The priority of all threads on the waiting list are determined as described
above (B2). The first thread with maximum priority is chosen and unblocked.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

Lock acquire causes sema_down() to be called on the internal semaphore. No
changes have been made to sema_down() in this project - if the process can
enter, the semaphore value is decremented. Otherwise, it is put on the waiters
list and blocked. The scheduler then chooses the first thread with the highest
priority to run next.

Once it has entered successfully, the lock holder is saved, and the lock is
entered into the thread's list of held locks.

Combined with the process described in B2, this is sufficient to handle
priority donation. There is no special handling for nested donations. Recursive
priority calculation in thread_get_priority_recursive() handles this case
with ease.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

The lock holder is set to NULL and the lock is removed from the held locks 
list. sema_up() is then called, which goes through all threads on the waiting
list and unblocks the first one with maximum priority. Since the unblocked
thread has a higher priority than the currently running thread, thread_yield()
is called and the unblocked thread is scheduled.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

In general, if thread_set_priority() does any bookkeeping (i.e. modifying lists,
changing the thread struct) and is interrupted by for example a thread waking up
from a timer, the state of the thread system may be corrupted.

This cannot happen in our implementation as we only change thread->priority, and then
calculate the actual priorities (after donation) on the fly. Thus if the thread
is interrupted while changing its priority it either has the new, or the old
priority and the next thread to run is determined by using thread_get_priority_of().

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

Using recursive priority calculation is simple. There is very little
book-keeping involved - only held locks and waiting threads must be saved. The
waiting list was already provided by the semaphore implementation. Special
cases like nested donation handle themselves.

This design has issues when a wait cycle is concerned, since it will enter
an infinite recursion when trying to calculate thread priority.

This is prevented by limiting the depth of the recursion as described in B2.

Another design we considered was calculating actual thread priority whenever
something caused it to change (lock_acquire(), lock_release(), thread creation,
etc). An advantage to this design was that much less superfluous calculation was
required. However, it seemed to be much harder to keep track of changes correctly.
