Operating System Development, 2012S
===================================

This repository contains our solutions for the course Operating System
Development / Programmierung von Betriebssystemen at Vienna University of
Technology held during summer semester 2012.

The course follows Stanford's CS 140 and consists of programming various parts
of the operating system Pintos. Stanford's original instructions may be found
at http://www.scs.stanford.edu/07au-cs140/pintos/pintos.html#SEC_Contents, and
the Pintos source code is hosted at http://repo.or.cz/w/pintos.git.

Note to current students: you are obviously free and welcome to examine
our code (even though it might be more fun for you if you didn't), but
handing in a copy of our code *will* result in a failing grade.
